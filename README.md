# Heart Attack Prediction Model
## Overview
This project implements a Heart Attack Prediction Machine Learning Model that estimates the likelihood of a heart attack for a patient based on their health parameters. The model uses the **Random Forest algorithm** and achieves very high accuracy, making it a reliable tool for medical analysis and decision-making.
## Applications
- Healthcare Providers: Aid in early diagnosis and risk assessment for heart disease.
- Hospitals: Prioritize patients based on their likelihood of a heart attack, optimizing emergency care.
- Insurance Companies: Assist in risk profiling for health insurance policies.
- Preventive Health Programs: Identify high-risk individuals for targeted interventions.
